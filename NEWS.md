Changes
=======

v0.6 (2012-02-18)
-----------------

* Use `GHC.Generics` instead of `Data.Generics` (from Scrap Your
  Boilerplate).  In addition to being more flexible, it has a more
  straightforward implementation, and the `Sexpable` type class is
  open to extension.

* Change the encoding for constructor slightly to make it more normal.
